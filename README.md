# fshare

A lightweight RESTful service to upload, share, view and delete files via UUID-based links.

## Features

- Simple REST API for file sharing
- API keyâ€“based user isolation
- Each API key gets a dedicated "home" folder
- Uploaded files are stored under `/upload/<user-uuid>/filename`
- File preview with syntax highlighting (for code/text files)
- Optional auto-deletion after a configurable number of hours
- Soft delete support (`deleted_at` timestamp)

---

## Behavior

- Each API key maps to one user-specific home directory.
- Only file uploads are currently supported â€“ folders are not yet handled.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fshare.git
cd fshare
```

### 2. Prepare the upload directory

```bash
mkdir -p ./data/uploads
```

> Make sure the directory matches the path configured in your config file.

### 3. Run fshare

#### First start (creates initial API key):

```bash
go run ./src --config ./data/config.json --api-key 123 --comment "initial key"
```

#### Subsequent starts:

```bash
go run ./src --config ./data/config.json
```
